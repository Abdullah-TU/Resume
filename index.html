<p>Enthusiastic Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer with over 2 years of experience in data analysis. Proficient in Python, R, SQL, and Microsoft Power BI, 
and possess specialized skills in machine learning algorithms, image analysis, and natural language processing (NLP).</p>

<p>After working on several projects within web development, I developed a keen interest in utilizing data for business decision-making. This led me to pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science with a focus on Data Science at Tampere University. Throughout my academic journey, I wrote a master’s thesis for Valmet, where I recommended Power BI as the preferred business intelligence (BI) tool. This recommendation was successfully implemented,
 demonstrating my ability to provide impactful insights and drive positive change.p>

<p>I have a unique talent for data analytics and visualization, treating it as an artistic endeavor from start to finish, 
which is influenced by my professional background as an artist.</p>
